# A DoD that we can all use

## What is a DOD
A DoD (Definition of Done) is a list of items that need to be fulfilled in order to consider a feature or story to be complete. It is a **minimum** list, so you can have more specific DoDs for specific features.

## Why is it important
By having a common DoD we can all make sure that features that we are working on, that we think are complete, actually are. This way we can avoid miscommunication and duplication of work.

## How to use a DoD

The DoD should be a list of items that every feature or story needs to be completed. It should be used by the team to verify a feature or story is ready for release.

## Creating a DoD

To create a DoD, you should start with some basics, then add items that are important to your team, and refine your DoD over time.

### Start with the basics

To start a DoD, start with a set of basic items that are applicable to most teams:

1. Code is tested
2. All necessary checks have run
3. Code is reviewed
4. Code is checked in
5. Code is deployed

### Add items

You might have other items that are important to your team, such as:

1. Code is documented

## Refine

As you use your DoD, you may find there are items on the list that donâ€™t need to be there. Make sure your team is comfortable with the DoD.

## Using the DoD

Once you have a DoD, you can use it to verify that a feature or story is ready for release.
